  See http://www.tcfb.com/dowseware/cmp-z-it.zip
      http://web2.airmail.net/markn/articles/zlibtool/zlibtool.htm

3) compress() returns Z_BUF_ERROR

  Make sure that before the call of compress, the length of the
  compressed buffer is equal to the total size of the compressed buffer
  and not zero.  For Visual Basic, check thathe is parameter is passed
  by reference ("as any"), not by value ("as long").

  Make sure that before the call avail_in and avail_out are not zero.
